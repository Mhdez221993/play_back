# Play Back

Introducing our new playback app that connects to your Spotify account and allows you to easily search for songs and play them! <br />
The app was built using Node with Express in the back-end and React in the front-end, making it easy to use and navigate.

Once you log in to your Spotify account through the app, you can easily search for songs and select them to play. <br />
If the song has lyrics available, the app will display them so you can sing along! <br />

The app is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and modern interface that is easy to navigate
